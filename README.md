# Galamsey Reporting & Reward Platform 🌍⛏️

## Overview
The Galamsey Reporting Platform is a web application that enables citizens to report illegal mining (galamsey) activities in a transparent, secure, and incentive-driven way.  
By combining **blockchain technology** and **AI**, the platform ensures data integrity, user trust, and rewards community participation.

---

## Problem
Illegal mining (galamsey) causes severe environmental damage, water pollution, and loss of livelihoods.  
Traditional reporting systems lack:
- Transparency
- Trust in data handling
- Motivation for citizens to report incidents

---

## Solution
This project provides:
- A **digital reporting platform** for galamsey activities
- **On-chain verification and rewards** using smart contracts
- **AI-powered summarization** of reports for faster insights

---

## Key Features
- 📍 Submit galamsey reports with location and description  
- 🔐 Secure authentication using Supabase (OTP & Magic Link)  
- 🤖 AI summarization using Google Gemini API  
- ⛓️ Smart contract that rewards users for valid reports  
- 🦊 Wallet connection via MetaMask  
- 🌐 Deployed on Scroll Testnet  

---

## MVP Scope
- User authentication
- Report submission form
- On-chain reward mechanism
- Wallet connection
- Basic dashboard for report history
- AI-generated summaries

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 
- **Backend:** Supabase
- **Blockchain:** Scroll Testnet
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **Web3 SDK:** Thirdweb
- **Wallet:** MetaMask
- **AI:** Google Gemini API

---

## On-Chain Functionality
- Each report submission triggers a smart contract function
- The contract records the report and rewards the user
- Users earn points/tokens visible in their connected wallet
- All transactions are verifiable on the Scroll blockchain

---

## User Flow
1. User signs in using OTP or Magic Link  
2. User connects wallet (MetaMask)  
3. User submits a galamsey report  
4. Smart contract processes the submission  
5. User earns a reward on-chain  
6. AI summarizes the report for analysis  

---

## Deployment
- Smart contract deployed on **Scroll Testnet**
- Frontend integrated with **Thirdweb SDK**
- Backend hosted with **Supabase**
- Hosted on **Vercel**

---

## Why This Project Matters
- Encourages civic participation through incentives  
- Improves transparency in environmental reporting  
- Demonstrates a real-world **consumer crypto use case**  
- Supports environmental protection using decentralized technology  

---

## Future Improvements
